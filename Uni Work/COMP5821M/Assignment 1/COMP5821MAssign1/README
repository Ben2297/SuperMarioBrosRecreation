Files

The files Cartesian3.h & Cartesian3.cpp are untouched. They are the same as in the faceindex2directededge solution.

The files diredge.h & diredge.cpp are a refactored version of the solution the faceindex2directededge solution. They place the diredge arrays into a struct and have two key methods - one for converting triangle soup to a diredgeMesh and one for converting a diredgeMesh to a triangle soup.

The files io.h & io.cpp have methods for reading a writing a triangle soup to/from a file.

The main.cpp file contains the solution to the assignment.
